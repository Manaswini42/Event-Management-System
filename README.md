# DBS Mini-Project

EventifyMIT is a project designed to streamline eventmanagement and coordination within the Manipal community.  
Built using a stack comprising Node.js for server-side logic, Express.js for handling HTTP requests, and PostgreSQL for data storage, EventifyMIT ensures efficient data management and retrieval. Additionally, it utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface, with dynamic content rendered using the EJS templating engine.
